# Teensy Code - what it's for

The code in the teensy_tft file needs to be uploaded to the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller used on the Thermometry Sensor board:

Download the two Teensy Loader links (boxed in red) and install the packages - One is the Teensyduino application and a second loader just called Teensy:

The website will instruct you on how to download these apps.

### **Note** 

The Teensy app (left side of above image) does not directly get downloaded into your applications folder.
I'd recommend dragging and placing it there so you don't have to go searching for it.



The teensy_tft file in this repository will be opened through the Teensyduino application. 
When uploading the teensy_tft file, make sure that you are uploading a ***.zip*** file and not a folder.
When the files here are downloaded from this repository, they will already be in a .zip format.
Upload the teensy code exactly how it is downloaded.
